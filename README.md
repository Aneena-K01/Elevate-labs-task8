This project presents an interactive Sales Dashboard built using Tableau with the Sample Superstore dataset. The dashboard analyzes sales performance across regions, product categories, and monthly trends from 2014–2017. Key visualizations include a monthly sales trend line chart, regional sales comparison bar chart, and category-wise donut chart with interactive filters. The analysis highlights top-performing regions and categories while identifying overall growth patterns and seasonal fluctuations in sales.
